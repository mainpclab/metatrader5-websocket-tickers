   ```

3. Install any dependencies if required. Refer to the documentation of the libraries used in the project.

## Usage

To start streaming ticker updates, follow these steps:

2. Create a new Expert Advisor (EA) and copy the provided MQL5 code into it.
3. Compile the EA.
4. Attach the EA to a chart in MetaTrader 5.
5. Connect your WebSocket server to receive updates.

### Example Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to set up the WebSocket connection in your EA:

void OnTick()
{
    // Your code to handle ticks
    WebSocketSend("ticker_update", GetTickerData());
}
